A Weather App that displays the current weather and a one week weather forecast.

Supports manual search and automatic user location detection.

Personal project to learn how to access data from APIs and display it in a clear manner.

APIs used: 
- [visualcrossing](https://www.visualcrossing.com/) for weather data
- [Google Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview) to convert geographic coordinates into displayable addresses.
